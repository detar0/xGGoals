# ⚽ Expected Goals vs Goals — Leagues Analysis

This project visualizes the relationship between **Expected Goals (xG)** and **Actual Goals** across multiple football leagues.  
The scatter plot helps identify:
- Players who **overperform** (score more than their xG predicts).
- Players who **underperform** (score less than their xG predicts).
- How scoring efficiency varies **between different leagues**.
